            Hi! I'm am a software developer originally from Manchester, England and now based in Vienna, Austria.
        </p>
        <p>I mostly do front-end web development and specialize in JavaScript in general and AngularJS in particular.</p>
        <p>I've been making computers do things since I was in my teens,
            <a ui-sref="post({ id: 65, title: 'confessions-of-an-intermediate-programmer' })">with varying degrees of success</a>.
        </p>
        <p>By day I work on building business and e-commerce applications.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to keep myself busy exploring more exciting aspects of web technologies, such as canvas,
            animations and the web-audio API. You can see the result of some of my experimentation on the
        <a ui-sref="projects">projects page</a>.</p>

        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>This is a place where I record my thoughts and discoveries which are more or less related to programming. I tend to
        prefer long-form articles, because I like the sound of my own fingers tapping keys.</p>
        <p>This website was built with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, with
            <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://wp-api.org/" target="_blank">WP-API</a> in the back providing the content.
            <a ui-sref="post({ id: 228, title: 'experiences-building-a-website-with-angularjs-wp-api-wordpress-api' })">Here is an article I wrote</a> about how I put it together.
